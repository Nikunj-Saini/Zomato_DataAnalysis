# Zomato Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Zomato restaurant dataset to uncover business insights related to customer preferences, pricing strategies, restaurant ratings, and service types. The objective is to analyze patterns in restaurant data and extract actionable insights using Python data science libraries.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, and data visualization — essential for real-world data analysis roles.
